You are not exactly the most talented at witchcraft. All you can produce is a sly trick here and there altering your opposites perception a little. This usually results in steering up  misunderstandings between others, which you take great delight in watching as they unfold.

<strong>Passive</strong>

Silver Tongue: Every phase you may send away one harmful or killing intent visitor. You are informed if you did, but not for what reason. 

- During the day you will send away the first player that attempts to harm you.
- During the night you will send away visitors with the priority of: Harmful visits (RBs, Redirects etc) &gt; lingering injuries or poisons &gt; Direct attacks.
- The first time someone tries to investigate if you are on their team or not, you will send them away as the highest priority that night.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-881933658318049350 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=881933658318049350><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="08/30/2021 12:09 PM">12:09</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Night Ability</strong>

Intervene: You may visit a player every night, this can have multiple effects. 

- If your target is visited by nobody then you will roleblock your target.
- If your target is visited by one other player then you role block that player and your target.
- If your target is visited by two or more players, then you will redirect them to instead visit each other forming a circle of visits should there be more than two other visitors. 
-&gt; In the last scenario, the order will be taken from the alive lists neighbouring position. The visitor that is from the top of the list the first will visit the player that comes next going down the list, going further down for all other visitors. 

If any player you redirect is redirection immune, then you will not affect them at all. If the remaining amount of visitors is less than two then they will instead be role blocked, if they are still two or more then the remaining players will be redirected into each other as usual, leaving out redirection immune players.

You will know the number of targets your ability affected, but not what it did and role block immune players will also be listed.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="08/31/2021 8:23 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-881933678727528528 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=881933678727528528><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="08/30/2021 12:09 PM">12:09</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Day Ability</strong>

Bad Mouth: You may bad mouth another player. This will leave a <strong>permanent</strong> additional vote on them. This vote will stay on them as long as you are alive.

- The additional votes will disappear if you die, as your magic that affected the other witches leaves the community they will see that you were the one to incite hatred between them.
- If another player uses a day action on the same person you bad mouthed that day, then they will know your name. 
- You may not bad mouth the same player twice in a row, in order to not gain too much suspicion on yourself. You have to wait one day until you can target the same player again.

<strong>Necronomicon Passive</strong>

Create a Copy for yourself: The first time you receive the Necronomicon you will create a copy of it, it will be passed on should you die with the copy.

Smooth Talker: Silver Tongue is upgraded, you will now also send away anyone trying to investigate you for your role, abilities or alignment in addition to one other harmful visitor.

<strong>Necronomicon Active</strong>

Great Revelation: When holding the Necronomicon you become empowered in your mind altering magic. During the day you may type /reveal <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Lunex#0727">@Lunexia on Osu!</span> into the voting channel, should you do so then you will be revealed as the &quot;Great Diviner&quot;. 

- Revealing will make you gain two additional votes and you will stay revealed as long as you have the Necronomicon.

<strong>Necronomicon passage</strong>

You will lose The Necronomicon at the end of the night of the day you received it, regardless of if you decided to use it&#39;s action, or not.
This does not affect your copied Necronomicon.

<strong>Win Condition</strong>

Exurbia, Witch of the Worlds Edge - Coven

You bide your time on this doomed planet, waiting for the apocalypse to strike. Everything has been long doomed to fail, everybody else just hasn&#39;t seen it yet. But you did, you know, everything will fall, and with everything, you too will fall. Now, you will be trying your best to prevent this world from falling, but what can you possibly do? Your research is dedicated to prevent the world&#39;s fall, everyone in the Coven may call you a lunatic for it, but they will see, they will all see! And if they don&#39;t that&#39;s not your problem any longer. If they believe you, good for them.. if not, oh well. 

<strong>Passive</strong>

Doomsday Research: The world will be ending soon. Some of the witches are plotting to ruin everything, and you know it! You are the only one who could possibly stop them, and you are determined to be the one that will stop them all dead in their tracks! At the start of the game the game will automatically end in <strong>every player</strong> losing at the end of day 4, should the game not have ended by then. It is your mission to find a way to prevent this.

Doomsday Bringers: There seem to be some rats within the Coven, trying to bring fall to this world. At the start of the game there will be 6 other players. You have to ensure that they are either dead, or pacified by your hands before day 4. But who are they? Where are they hiding?

Doomsday Counter: You know that with every removed doomsday bringer doomsday will come, but slower. Every time one of them is eliminated the time until the final day increases by 2 phases.

<strong>Night Ability</strong>

Kreee, the Dumb Witch - Coven

You&#39;ve always struggled with forming your incantations properly, struggled even more with remembering the right recipe and the most with holding proper conversations as you messed up once again. Honestly, anything you do seems to be failing, even if you tried your best.. but you figured that it&#39;s not that bad, in fact do you like the randomness in your results. You misspell part of an incantation, and once instead of summoning a little flame you let it rain frogs for a minute..

<strong>Passive</strong>

Evading Responsibility: Whenever a non-killing action is used on you, it is redirected to a random player on your team instead. In turn can you not be saved by protective actions, or affected by any other action that doesn&#39;t intend to murder you.

<strong>Night Ability</strong>

Try yourself on an incantation: You choose two targets you want to use your spell on in order [Target 1] and [Target 2].

You will either;

- Redirect target 1&#39;s action into target 2
- Transport target 1 and target 2 with each other
- Role block target 2.

<strong>Day Ability</strong>

Try yourself on a potion: You choose a target and they will be affected by a potion you give to them. They are informed of being made to drink a potion. 

The potion will either;

- Make them tell you the name of their night ability
- Make them tell you the name of their day ability
- Make them unable to vote during the rest of the day (they are told that they cannot vote) and their current vote is removed should they have one

<strong>Necronomicon Passive</strong>

Evading Danger: You may choose who you redirect visitors onto during the night you hold the necronomicon, this includes killing visitors.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-885197217013575680 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=885197217013575680><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="09/08/2021 12:17 PM">12:17</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Necronomicon Action</strong>

Ressurection?: You may attempt to ressurect a dead player, you have to target one other player to attempt this, that player can be yourself.

The results of the summoning can be;

- You resurrect your target.
- The resurrection fails.
- You resurrect your target, but the other person dies (through healing, but not immunity).
- You resurrect your target and the other person is protected for the night.
- The resurrection fails and the other person dies (through healing, but not immunity).
- The resurrection fails, but the other person is protected for the night.

You may not use this ability again, once you successfully ressurected another player.

You are a very special member of the Coven. Many years ago you were summoned by the Coven leader as her pet, but she soon found out that you are far more capable than that. For a cat you are as smart as a human and as adapt as any other witch of the coven, if not more. All you lack is the innate ability to speak, which you soon learned to bypass by using magical telepathy.
Now, you are adored by everyone, while respected just as much. You like dressing up like a human would, well, similar enough, with a robe, while still walking on all fours, and a hat on your head.

<strong>Passive</strong>

A cats charm: If your neighbours are target of a protective action, then you gain a copy of that protection for the night it is applied to them. Should their protection last longer, yours will not, unless it was directly applied to you.

<strong>Night Ability</strong>

Vision: You conjure a vision, which will contain the names of 5 different players every night. At least two of them will be on your team.

<strong>Day Ability</strong>

Reanimate: You may use the day action of a dead player.

You may only use each dead player once, and you have to choose one of their day actions to use should they have multiple.
Some day actions may not work, in which case you are informed that the action failed. You may choose to try using &quot;reanimate&quot; again during those days, using a different day action.

<strong>Necronomicon Passive</strong>

Protective Magic: During a night you hold the Necronomicon, you are immune to direct attacks.

<strong>Necronomicon Action</strong>

Insight: During a night you are holding the Necronomicon, you may choose to use &quot;Insight&quot; instead of &quot;Vision&quot;. If you do then you will receive 5 names, but instead will at least one of the 5 players named be opposing your team.

<strong>Necronomicon passage</strong>

You will lose The Necronomicon at the end of the night of the day you received it, regardless of if you decided to use it&#39;s action, or not.

You are a witch with a cursed Stigma implanted into you, making you transform into a bird during the night. Your innate witchcraft abilities are that of being able to summon and control ice, which are enhanced during the night when you transform into a bird.
Due to your curse you have been avoided by others all your life, merely being tolerated, but not really accepted in the Coven. This has made you feel disconnected from the current Coven&#39;s society over the course of time.
Then as a witch came to you, proposing that together you could reform the current coven, making it a place where all witches can live a proud life, you were motivated into joining her endeavours.

<strong>Passive</strong>

Freezing Aura: Anyone visiting you or a player above or below you in the alive list at night will be unable to use their day action during the following phase. They will be informed that they were unable to use it, but not why, should they attempt to use it.

This effect is only applied during the night, when you transform into a bird and when your witchcraft is at its strongest.

<strong>Night Ability</strong>

Glacial Prison: Every Even night you may attempt to imprison a player in ice. If they were not protected or immune to lingering or direct attacks then they will be announced missing starting the following day, and continually announced missing at the start of future days. Additionally are they fully removed from play for the duration of their imprisonment.

Anyone currently held by your ice will be freed should you die at any point.
This ability can only be used by you.
This ability cannot affect other Coven Traitors.

<strong>Day Ability</strong>

Inflict Cold: You speak an incantation which will summon the effects of a severe cold in your target. They will become unable to change, add or remove their vote for the remainder of the day.

Anderson, <s>the Witch of Contradiction</s>, Priest of the Vatican Church - <s>Coven Traitors</s> Holy Vatican Churches High Priest.

You have infiltrated the Coven in the name of the Holy Vatican Church, your real name is Alexander Anderson, a trained hunter of <s>vampires</s> <strong>Witches</strong>, your fake identity within the Coven however, is that of <strong>Alex, the Witch of Contradiction</strong>. A fitting name, for one that is unable to reproduce witchcraft, not being born with innate witch talent. You have a magical disguise making you look like one of the witches, but unlike witches, you wield holy magic, as well as an arsenal of weaponry to aid you in your hunt to eliminate the witches of the Coven in the Holy Vatican Churches&#39; name. For that matter you have joined the Traitors within the Coven, which also seek to eliminate as many witches as possible, to overthrow the Coven Leader, and take Control of the Coven. While they are a tool for you to abuse, you yourself do not really see them as more than that.

<strong>Passive</strong>

Holy Mantle: You are immune to attacks at night, but not to lingering injuries, or poisons.

<strong>Night Ability</strong>

Contradicting Magic: As you do not have the ability to wield witchcraft and use their incantations and lack the information for their brewery, you rely on your holy magic. Every night you may choose another player to blind with holy light, they will not receive any night feedback that night, and if not immune to role blocking will their action be stopped.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="09/14/2021 1:18 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-887386679965548614 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=887386679965548614><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="09/14/2021 1:17 PM">13:17</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Day Ability</strong>

Holy extermination Arsenal: You wield your blessed weapons to aid you in your hunt. Every day you may choose a player to attack, that player will start bleeding, and will die at the end of the following days night, if not treated before that.

If visited by another player during that day phase, then that other player will learn that you also visited that same player during the day.
You do not learn if anyone saw you visit.
Your target is informed of bleeding once the day ends as you strike when the lynching takes place.

<strong>Necronomicon</strong>

As you are not a witch, but a priest of the holy church, you cannot wield the Necronomicon, should anyone attempt to pass it on to you, you will simply hold on to it for the night and then pass it on as is custom in order to not rouse suspicion.

You are always the last to receive the Necronomicon, and the traitors Necronomicon.

Should you receive the Traitors Necronomicon then:

<strong>Traitors Necronomicon</strong>

Dark Influence: You manage to utilise the forbidden and stronger Necronomicon to your advantage, boosting your physical abilities.

Your bleeding caused by <strong>Holy extermination Arsenal</strong> can no longer be healed.

<strong>Win Condition</strong>

You win if either:

- You are alive when the traitors win by parity. Ending the game in a traitor witch and your win.
- You are alive, when all other witches are dead. Ending the game in your win alone.

- If you have died and all other players are dead, or only the traitor witches remain, meaning your mission to exterminate the witches was successful. You and the traitor witches win.
-&gt; This can also happen if all remaining players are affected by a lingering injury or poison, and nobody to heal it is left in the game. The game will end in your win in this case, even if a team other than the traitor witches would have won.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Delphie, the All-Seeing Witch of Knowledge - Coven Traitors Leader

You have always been the Coven Leader&#39;s left hand providing aid in both your magical abilities as well as your collected knowledge, granting the coven never seen before prosperity. In fact have you been the only factor doing so. You&#39;ve always been the hard working part, leading the coven on your own, while the Coven Leader didn&#39;t do anything but provide you more work to occupy your valuable time.
One day you had enough and sought to change the coven, so that you could lead it yourself to a better and brighter future without being hindered by the current, rather narrow minded, Coven Leader.

<strong>Passive</strong>

Necronomicon Duplicator: During the first day, you will hold and produce a copy of the Necronomicon. You will finish it at the end of the first night and hold it during the following second day, should you be still alive then. 

Influence: Due to your influence in the Coven will nobody dare to harm you. You are immune to direct attacks.

<strong>Night Ability</strong>

Eyes in the Sky: You are able to summon hawks, eagles and other birds to aid you as your eyes. Every night you may choose another player, you will know who they visited and who visited them.

<strong>Day Ability</strong>

Internal Documents: You may target a player every day, and learn if they are currently holding the Necronomicon or not, if yes then you will also learn the name of their Necronomicon ability.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="09/17/2021 10:08 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-888426191462236191 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=888426191462236191><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="09/17/2021 10:08 AM">10:08</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Necronomicon Passive</strong>

Improving the Necronomicon: During the second day, while holding the copied Necronomicon, you will improve it with your own knowledge, creating the traitor Necronomicon. You will hold the traitor necronomicon at the start of day 3. You will pass it on to the next traitor coven member should you die after that. If you die before the start of day three, then you will send the remaining members of the traitors a spiritual message from the afterlife, making them able to complete the traitor Necronomicon by the start of day 4.

<strong>Necronomicon Action</strong>

Oracle Delphie: During a night you are holding the Necronomicon, you are able to learn the name of the ability your target is using, and you will receive all night feedback your target would have received, even if they didn&#39;t receive it themselves.

<strong>Necronomicon passage</strong>

You will lose The Necronomicon at the end of the night of the day you received it, regardless of if you decided to use it&#39;s action, or not.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-888426212702179329 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=888426212702179329><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="09/17/2021 10:08 AM">10:08</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Traitor Necronomicon Passive</strong>

Overwhelming Mental Pressure: Once you receive the Traitor&#39;s Necronomicon you are able to emmit immense mental pressure towards those around you. As a side effect is no one able to deduce if you are on their side or not, so they will assume you are on their side, should they question your intentions. Additionally will anybody attempting to harm you with a lingering injury or poison be role blocked should they not be immune to it.

<strong>Traitor Necronomicon Action</strong>

Manipulate Lifelines: If you are holding the Traitor Necronomicon, then you may predict and then manipulate the death of another player every night through reading their magical lifelines and altering them to your liking. You may name the host a specific phase that is at the earliest the end of the following night. That player will die at the end of that phase even through protection or immunities.

The player will know that &quot;someone read their magical lifeline and determined that they will die soon&quot;.
The reading is not astral, but the attack will be. You are not seen visiting the player during the night or day they die, and the attack cannot be roleblocked or otherwise stopped and will definitely hit the player you chose.
The player will only die if you are alive during the phase of their death.
You can mark multiple players to die during the same phase, should you set night 3&#39;s on day 7 as well as night 4s and night 5s. Then they will all die at the end of day 7.
