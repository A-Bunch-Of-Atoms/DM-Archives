Return of the Thunderdome - The Epic Clash - Town Investigative

&gt;&gt; Alright Meeting time.
&gt;&gt; What&#39;s the issue.
&gt;&gt; I think Thunderdomes provoque toxicity and problems in games. They need to stop.
&gt;&gt; What?! Are you insane? Name one time a thunderdome resulted in toxicity.
&gt;&gt; UHH~ You and Duncan, You and Phone, You and Me, Jaiden and Todd, Phone and Nashed need I go on?
&gt;&gt; Ok Ok Fair Point....
&gt;&gt; So Stop the damned Thunderdomes.
&gt;&gt; No

Vote Analysis: Every night you may target a player (excluding yourself) that has voted during the past day, you will receive the alignment of the player your target voted.

Thunderdome Analysis (passive): If your target voted someone who also voted your target (hidden or openly) then you will know and also check your targets alignment.

Thunderdome Madness (Passive): If you vote a player that is voting you, then your vote power is secretly DOUBLED (not +1 -&gt; it&#39;s x2, so if you had 2 votes, now it&#39;s 4.). The votes will not be displayed in the vote counter until day end, at which they will be displayed in the final counting.

Thunderdome Overload (passive): If &quot;Thunderdome Madness&quot; was triggered at the end of the past day then you may not use &quot;Thunderdome Analysis&quot; during the night after it. The same applies to if &quot;Thunderdome Analysis&quot; was applied during the past night. Additionally if &quot;Thunderdome Analysis&quot; was applied during the last night, then &quot;Thunderdome Madness&quot; will be deactivated during the next day.

Goal: Take down those who oppose the town.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="12/13/2021 4:23 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Mafia Engine - Town Support

The current version of Mafia Engine. The best and most advanced iteration yet.
A true masterpiece, yet unfinished.
I am almost there, everything is going smoothly. Just a little bit more. - Anonymous Bot Developer 1923

Bot Status: ACCEPTED! Bot ID Number: 502JKL5739A.

Order Reassignment: Target two players at night. Both players will be directed to be at the other players location that night. All visits performed on one of them will instead be performed on the other.
- You may not relocate yourself or another Mafia Engine Chat member.
- Other Mafia Engine Chat members IGNORE your relocation and will visit their target as planned should they visit someone you relocated.

Server Restructuring [1x]: Once per game during the night you may choose to relocate every living member of the Mafia Engine Chat. For each living member choose one non-member to swap that member with.

Overloaded [Passive] After using &quot;Server Restructuring&quot; you become overloaded and unable to use &quot;Order Reassignment&quot; the following night.
The Three Prototypes [Passive] There are two other prototypes of Mafia Engine&#39;s in the game. They may be any role of any alignment, you will share a day/night chat with them.
The Third Prototype [Passive] You are the most complete build of Mafia Engine, yet you are unfinished. Should you be the last mafia engine alive then you may use one last action of the Mafia Engine ability pool before it becomes locked and unavailable.

Goal: Take down those who oppose the town.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&gt;&gt; I swear it did. I&#39;m not <em>that</em> drunk. - Goon
&gt;&gt; Is someone talking about me, perhaps? - Noose
&gt;&gt; Bloody hell, this.. this is creepy as hell - Mafioso

I think this isn&#39;t that bad, not that bad at all.. - Mafioso

<em>static noise overrules the following conversation</em>

Choose your victim (1x): Once per game and during the day, choose to activate this ability and name a target.
If a player that is not your target is lynched that day then the lynch will be redirected to your target, and the original lynch will instead have their role name and alignment (but not sub alignment) revealed.
If you were the one being lynched, then this ability fails.
You cannot choose yourself as the target.

Animate object (0x): You come to life, snaking through town to find a victim. Choose a player, you will start to strangle your victim tonight, roleblocking them during this night and the following day.
- Your victim will be informed that &quot;<em>something is strangling you</em>&quot;.
- Your victim will be informed that &quot;<em>You will die during the next night, unless someone protects you.</em>&quot;

- You may not act during the following day.
- You may not act during the following night.

A double edged... rope?! (passive): This ability let&#39;s you gain charges of &quot;Animate Object&quot;, but may also take them away.

- If a member of the town is lynched -&gt; Gain a charge.
- If a neutral is lynched -&gt; Nothing happens.
- If a member of the mafia is lynched -&gt; lose all charges you have stored, and if you are currently strangling someone, then your attack will fail during the following night.
- If the mafia Head is lynched -&gt; lose all charges you have stored, and if you are currently strangling someone, then your attack will fail during the following night and become unable to gain any new charges.

Just a Rope (Passive): You are RB immune during the nights you roleblock, but not during the nights you attack.

Goal: Kill all who oppose the mafia</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Retired Protector - Town Support

I Used to rule the world. The prosecutor of Discord Mafia. After attack of the Honda&#39;s and everything that I&#39;ve been through.... It&#39;s time for me to take my retirement. Someday I may return, nothing is official. For now... I&#39;m going to stay here and help out anyway I can. That.. I promise. 
- The Prosecutor

Veteran of the craft: Every night choose a player. You will remove negative status effects from them, and block new ones from being applied that night.

Weak Minded (Passive): You cannot remove brain washing from anyone, and if you visit a brain washed target, or a brain washer, then you will become brain washed yourself.

Last ace up your sleeve: Each day pick a player, if you die during the same day, or the following night, then the alignment of that player will be publicly revealed.

Goal: Take down those who oppose the town.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Dragon - Neutral Evil

Staff logs:
&gt;&gt; Hey, Lune.. - Eqsy
&gt;&gt; Yeah? - Lune
&gt;&gt; Dragon has become way too powerful recently, and with the wormhole opening we have to do something. - Eqsy
&gt;&gt; I mean, I don&#39;t <em>really</em> mind it, but I can see it.. I guess?! - Lune
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we really have to act. Any ideas? - Eqsy
&gt;&gt; I guess we can just kick him lol, his waifu is trash anyway <img

    src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/twitter/twemoji@latest/assets/svg/1f923.svg"> - Lune
&gt;&gt; <em>confused looks</em> .. Anyway, kicking sounds good, but what if he just rejoins? - Eqsy
&gt;&gt; Don&#39;t worry.. we&#39;ll just have nashed nashednuke dragons Wifi, it&#39;ll be fiiine - Lune
&gt;&gt; .. alright, we&#39;ll do that. Commence operation.  - Eqsy
&gt;&gt; Got it chief. - Lune

- End of log, totally the staff log. Yes. No doubt this happened.

Kimono Anivia&#39;s wings will guide you [3x]: During the night, choose another player, you and that player will be unvisitable that night, any visits performed on the both of you that phase will fail, any visitors will be informed that their target was missing.

99 K levels deep and still going: Target someone, their alignment will be shown as the opposite to investigatives that night. (non town -&gt; Town | Town -&gt; Mafia)

Cute like a cat (Passive): Any evil faction attempting to attack you will instead be told that you are a neutral evil, the first time they attack you. If the same faction attacks you again, then they will attack you as usual.

Nice Person [3x]: You&#39;re just generally nice to everyone, as a result are you pretty likeable and people are more reluctant to vote you. (You will also be lynched by majority one vote later than normal and in a plurality tie the other one will die.)

Ensure the towns destruction before or after your death.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Nashed - Town Investigative.

Log 001 - My first mafia game, I met a cool guy named JacksonVirgo. We&#39;re sharing a neighbourhood together It&#39;s been a blast. Trust is not a strongsuit for me so I have absolutely no clue if they&#39;re legit or not. ~~~ They did this huge Fancy Play and caught a mafia! Guess I better trust them! They&#39;re brilliant I swear. - October 2019

Log 002 - I decided to invite Jackson to my server, they keep requesting admin for goodness sake. I do trust them and all but I like the way the staff team is for now. - November 2019

Log 003 - Jackson is now known as Nashed. I decided to make them staff, not sure how things will go...... 

Log 004 - I Gave them owner but apparently a fight broke loose.... They&#39;re both gone. The server is dead

Log 005 - Nashed is back and we&#39;re ready to revamp the server. With his intelligence he&#39;s developing various prototypes of a bot called Mafia Engine to help out the server. I admire him sometimes but don&#39;t want to admit it. 

Abilities:
Observation: [3x] During the night watch a player, you will be informed of who visits them and who they visit. 

Fancy Play Syndrome [2x] During the night you may perform a fancy play. Target a player, should you get them lynched the following day you may reveal the role, alignment and sub-alignment of a player of your choosing.

Prototype Testing: [1x] You are aware there are 3 mafia engine prototypes, they all share a group chat. As your night action, you may decide to join their chat starting the following day. Everyone in that neighbourhood could be of any alignment and they will not know your role. - You may not gain any positive or negative effects distributed or present in the neighbourhood besides gaining access and the ability to talk in it


Goal: Take down those who oppose the town.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-922597364651409408 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=922597364651409408><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12/20/2021 4:12 PM">16:12</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Augie&#39;s Role</strong>

&gt;&gt; Sure. Go ahead. - Eqsy
&gt;&gt; Trust me, what could go wrong? The channel coming to life pinging everyone with polls? - Lune
&gt;&gt; Yeah right. As I said, go ahead. - Eqsy

Extended arm of the people&#39;s voice: Target someone every day, at night start a poll will be posted in the info channel, it will have options in it that everyone can vote on, each option names one thing that could happen to your target. The votes will be made public at the end of the night and the action with the most votes will be chosen.
The name of the target will be revealed.
Only the amount of votes will be made public, no names will be revealed. You may also vote and stay anonymous throughout the whole thing. 
You have to choose at least two of the options and may at most choose 4.
Voting is done in everyone&#39;s player chat.
People may decide to not vote. The number of people not voting will not be listed.
You cannot be role blocked doing this.

Options:

Note: Some options you can only put into your polls for a limited number of times.

- Protect 
- Role block
- Purge (1x) (protect + remove negative status effects)
- Attack (2x)
- Alignment check (2x)
- Lookout (2x)
- track (2x)
- Make unable to vote the next day (2x)
- Make them a double voter the next day (2x)

Voice of the People (passive): Your vote will count as 2 in every poll you participate in.

Final Word [1x]: Once per game during the night you may overpower everyone elses votes and decide the outcome of the poll yourself.
- By doing so will you be revealed as the pollmaster at the start of the next day.

Goal: Take down those who oppose the town.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-922597847407403089 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=922597847407403089><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12/20/2021 4:14 PM">16:14</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Phone&#39;s Role</strong>

2020/08/25 - I&#39;m back... Likey is gone though. Ever since the incident of the wormhole. She just hasn&#39;t been the same. Blames it on college and work but I know she&#39;s gone... She&#39;s gone.. She&#39;s gone... There&#39;s nothing we can do to bring her back..
2020/11/25 - The server is a year old. It&#39;s hard to believe without her. This server wouldn&#39;t exist to this day
2021/11/25 - Something is wrong.. I can feel it...

The development of the Engine that will one day drive the entire server has proceeded well and appears to show its first fruit.
We are now able to control parts of the server.
Everything is going according to plan, just a little bit more..

OOP, got to recode everything for the next few steps, aha.
Well, for now let&#39;s put this one into active duty. - Anonymous Bot Developer 1923

Bot Status: ACCEPTED! Bot ID Number: 302K476L3323.

Lockdown: Target a player every night. Any visitors of your target will have their visit fail, unless the visit was either an attack or a protective visit, or a visit by another mafia engine.
Group Security [1x]: Once per game during the night you may choose to use Lockdown on any other alive mafia engines and yourself.

Secure Code [Passive] You cannot be role blocked.
The Three Prototypes [Passive] There are two other prototypes of Mafia Engine&#39;s in the game. They may be any role of any alignment, you will share a day/night chat with them.
The Second Prototype [Passive] Should the first prototype die, then you may choose which, if any, Mafia Engine ability should be used.

Goal: Take down those who oppose the town.</code></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Q.: No, I figured it out during the first major test in 2019. I knew then.
Interrogator L.: And you have not written down or informed anyone of your findings?
Q.: No, I have not.
Interrogator L.: Why is that? Depending on your answer major or minor disciplinary measures will be enacted.
Q.: I did not want my experiment to fail. That is all I have to say.
Interrogator L.: Thank you for your answers, that is all. You will now be escorted to your cell in REDACTED until further notice.

James, what did you expect? Decent flavour? You WISH my friend.
Yes lune this is quite literally the flavour ^

Forged Papers: With your knowledge, forging other&#39;s papers is easy for you, leaving behind corroborative evidence, indisputable and unprovable to be forged. Target a player each night, they will be seen as a member of the mafia to alignment checks.
- This will overwrite other abilities and passives that influence how someone is seen to investigatives, unless stated otherwise in the specific ability/passive.

Sticky Note: Every day, attach a sticky note to someone. If the target dies during or at the end of this day after you targeted them, or until the end of the next night, then the sticky note will be found and made public. You may write up to 200 characters onto each note.
The sticky note will be announced like the following during the dead players reveal:
&quot;[Player] has died(cause of death might vary) [time of death]&quot;
&quot;They were [role] (or whatever should be here)&quot;
&quot;A note has been found on their body, placed there by someone.&quot;
&quot;[content of note]&quot;

- You may sticky note yourself and other members of the mafia.

Stolen Identity (Passive): You may give the hosts a secondary role name during pre game. You will receive a second role card at the end of night one made of that role name with a random town alignment. You are seen as that alignment and sub alignment to anyone that checks for those starting day 2 and you will additionally flip as that role should you die to lynching.

Confine: Each day target a player, you will confine them, role blocking them, but also protecting them during the following night. This additionally removes them from all private chats during the night.
- Your target will be told that someone confined them at night.
- If they had a private chat then the other players in it will know that your target disappeared.
- Your target will be told that they cannot act that night.

If you successfully confined your target then you may choose to perform one of the following actions in addition to role blocking and protecting them:

Experiment [3x]: During the night you may decide to Experiment on your target, this can have different effects on your target.
- If your target is a member of the Town: They will be protected the following night.
- If your target is a non-town: They will learn your name and that you are a town protective and that they only learned this because they are non-town.
- You will not know if the one you targeted was town or not, and if a town member is protected by you during the next night through &quot;Experiment&quot; then you will not know of this.

Whisper: You may send your target a 200 letter message that they will receive at the end of the night.

Decided to do a little experimenting. People seem to absolutely LOVE GIM and I&#39;m proud of my creation. I&#39;m curious what will happen if I start blending roles together. Not sure how this will work but let&#39;s see.

GIM Log #2
Things seem to be going relatively well. The role creation was a success. This should be one of the strongest roles in all of GIM

GIM Log #3
So. Turns out.  Merging roles together seems to default them to be evil... I&#39;ll be sure to monitor this abomination of a role and keep it contained for the meantime

Approximately an hour before game start:

&gt;&gt; The last town I was in, nobody believed me when I told them of the near unstoppable doomsday.. Bunch of none believers died for their sins. - .. Zach?
&gt;&gt; Wait, these aren&#39;t my memories, my thoughts? Who&#39;s there? - Zach
&gt;&gt; Oh, it seems I didn&#39;t get you fully out of my head. Well, you see, I must&#39;ve taken over you body by chance. Sorry about that, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get used to it eventually. - ???
&gt;&gt; What, no?! Get out of my body! - Zach
&gt;&gt; No can do. There is a doomsday to stop. I might consider it after my work is done. For now, let us spread the word, kiddo. Name&#39;s Exurbia, by the by. - Exurbia
&gt;&gt; *How old are you exactly?.. - Zach
&gt;&gt; No answer
&gt;&gt; sigh, okay old geezer, let&#39;s do this. - Zach

Doomsday?! AGAIN?!: Every night, check if someone was marked as a doomsday bringer. Additionally, if you were to target a source of destruction with this, then you will know.

Pacify: Every day, select someone to remove their doomsday bringer status from if they are in fact a doomsday bringer. Additionally, if you were to target a source of destruction with this, then you will know.
- You cannot target anyone you targeted with this before again.

Purge (1x): Once per game target someone. If they are a source of destruction, then you will purge them from this world no matter what (unstoppable). This is also counted as a lynch. Additionally, if the source of destruction is eliminated, gain an additional charge you may use on anyone.

Spread the Word (Passive): The amount of currently active doomsday bringers will be announced at the end of each phase. 
You will be announced as town once the doomsday threat is eliminated.

Corrupted (Passive): If you are marked as a doomsday bringer, then all your abilities, besides &quot;Purge&quot; cannot be used anymore. Make sure not to spill the beans.. to &quot;them&quot;.

Goal: Take down those who oppose the town.
Sub-Goal: Stop doomsday from happening!</code></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-927972468222722159 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=927972468222722159><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="01/04/2022 12:11 PM">12:11</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Zach ^ Modkilled Night 6</strong></span></div></div></div></div></div>

A sacrifice for the superiors: Each night target a player, if they die and flip as a member of the town the next day, then you will bind yourself to them. Once you bound yourself to someone can you no longer use this ability. 
- If you die then the person you bound yourself to will be revived.
- You cannot bind yourself to players that can act from the grave.

Going out with a bang: Should you die then you may decide to take down one other player with you. You may select that player before you die. You may change it at any time but the phase of your death, in case you changed it during that phase, then the last selection before that phase started will be taken instead.
- This ability will not trigger if you were lynched or killed by a member of the town.

Unknown Menace (passive): You are unknown, and that fact itself makes you strong, should you be alive at the start of day 8, then you gain permanent night immunity.

Goal: Take down those who oppose the town</code></span></div></div></div></div></div>
